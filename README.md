## A personal collection of handy scripts for quick imagemagick tweaks on the command line.

### make-square
Makes an image a square. Wow. Very dumb right now with the center of gravity being the center of the image.

### make-circle
This makes an image... into a circle! Surprise!

Because a circle is best made from a square, a common command would be:
```
make-circle < make-square image.jpg
```
